## Classifying Water Potability with Classification Models
* Classified water potability by its features, substance, chemical element, to determine whether it is safe for human consumption
* Preprocessed the data using procedures like data cleaning, correlation, and feature scaling
* Compared the ROC curve and accuracy score of machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian process classification
* Identified the most suitable method by error analysis
